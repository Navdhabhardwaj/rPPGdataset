**A New Diverse Dataset for rPPG Estimation, and Benchmarking with Standard Frameworks**

Description

This repository contains the **Diverse rPPG Dataset (DrPPG-25)** — a novel dataset curated to advance research in **remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)** and physiological signal estimation from facial videos.
The dataset comprises **high-resolution facial recordings** under varied conditions including illumination, skin tone, head motion, and emotional expression diversity. Each video sample is synchronized with corresponding **ground-truth RR intervals** acquired via a contact sensor.

Key Features:

* Participants: 46 individuals (balanced gender ratio, diverse age range)
* Resolution: 1080p @ 30 fps
* Duration: ~2 minutes per video
* Modalities: RGB video, contact PPG, metadata (age, gender, skin tone)

The dataset aims to benchmark algorithms for heart rate estimation, pulse waveform reconstruction, and robustness analysis across demographics.
